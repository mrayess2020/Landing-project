# Landing-project

Languages ( CSS,JS AND HTML).

All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

Styling has been added for active states.

There are 3 sections in the page and I added another section, So now there are 4 sections in the the page.

Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.

Each section is being viewed while scrolling through the page and when clicking the section name from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.

We access elements with the querySelectorAll() method

We use getElementbyId() to select a DOM element by its id.

We also access elements with getElementsByClassName().

We used forEach to loop sections.

Every element has an innerHTML property.
